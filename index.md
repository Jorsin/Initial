# NZNOG

NZNOG is the New Zealand Network Operators’ Group – an online community of network operators, predominantly in the Internet and Online Services area.

NZNOG has no king, president, or formal membership. It consists of the subscribers to the NZNOG mailing list. The group is intended to facilitate discussion among operators of networks in New Zealand on matters relevant to network operators.

Annual Conference
Our annual conference provides both an opportunity to exchange technical information, and a high-value opportunity for NZ’s networking staff to ‘network’ amongst themselves. This is New Zealand’s only technical networking conference.

The NZNOG Conference 2020 will be held in Christchurch at Rydges Latimer from January 28th to 31st, 2020.
