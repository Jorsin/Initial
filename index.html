# WAND Group  

WAND is a research group at the [University of Waikato](http://www.waikato.ac.nz/) [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/). The group is involved with a range of computer networks projects mostly focused around network measurement. The group has a strong international reputation and has close links, including collaborative research, with several other network measurement groups. These include CAIDA, Sprint and Agilent.

Our work includes collection of very long trace sets, network analysis and software to support this, active measurement systems, wireless networks for rural communities, rapid deployment networks, OS code based network simulation and network visualisation. Spinoffs from our work include [Endace](http://www.endace.com/) and [Rural Link](http://www.rurallink.co.nz/).
